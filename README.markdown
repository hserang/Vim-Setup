Haroun Serang's Vim Environment
=======================

I've become a fan of this project, with thanks to @banananeil for
 bringing it to my attention:
https://github.com/carlhuda/janus

Follow directions there, and continue with tmux install and
configuration

These are the config files to complete the environment. It is assumed
you have already installed janus and updated your .bash_profile and
.tmux.conf

Install tmux:
brew install tmux

Update copy/paste dependency:
brew install reattach-to-user-namespace
